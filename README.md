Cost Breakdown:
Labor/Manpower Cost (2019–2023):
Fairly stable across the years, slightly decreasing around 2021–2022.
Bounces back in 2023, maintaining levels close to $2.5M–$2.7M annually.
Raw Material Cost (Trend by Year/Month/Day):
Highly variable with noticeable peaks and troughs.
Spikes suggest seasonal or demand-driven procurement.
Costs remain mostly in the $450K–$500K range monthly.

Energy Cost:
Smallest component in the cost structure (7.51% of labor cost).
Minimal impact on total cost compared to other factors.
Profit vs Finished Goods Cost:
Positive relationship observed — higher finished goods cost correlates with higher profits.
Profit generally ranges between $10M–$18M.

Energy Consumption (kWh by Year):
Gradual decline from 2019 to 2021.
Uptick observed again in 2022 and 2023.
May suggest improvement in efficiency during the mid-period or changes in production scale.

Donut Chart Insight:
Labor dominates energy cost by a huge margin (≈93% vs ≈7%).

Key Business Insights:
Raw material is the major cost driver, indicating a strong dependency on material sourcing and price fluctuations.
Labor costs are stable and predictable, which is good for financial planning.
Energy costs are low but consumption is rising — a potential area to monitor for future sustainability.
Profitability improves with increased finished goods cost, suggesting value-added production or premium pricing strategy.
Overall cost management seems efficient, but raw material cost volatility and energy consumption trends deserve more attention.
